# Product Claims & Proof Rules

## Approved Claim Style
- Prefer concrete, process-level claims
- Explain how the product helps, not just outcomes

## Examples (Safe Framing)
- Helps keep selections and specs organized
- Makes project information easier to review and present
- Reduces workflow chaos by centralizing decisions

## Claims to Verify Before Use
- Quantified results (time saved, revenue impact, conversion lifts)
- Comparative claims ("better than X")
- Any statement implying enterprise features/security/compliance unless confirmed

## Never Claim Without Proof
- "Guaranteed" outcomes
- Specific performance numbers
- Features that are not shipped

## To Fill In
- Verified customer proof points
- Approved comparison framing
- Legal/compliance wording constraints
