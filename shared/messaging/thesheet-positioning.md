# thesheet Positioning

## What thesheet is
A project and specification workflow tool for interior designers.

## Core Value
thesheet helps designers keep product selections, specs, and project decisions organized so work is easier to review, present, and deliver.

## What it is not (guardrails)
- Not a generic "all-in-one" productivity app
- Not just a moodboard tool
- Not only a database/spreadsheet replacement (unless backed by clear context)

## Why people care (practical outcomes)
- Less scattered project information
- Clearer client-facing outputs
- Faster review and revision cycles
- Better project continuity over time

## To Fill In
- Differentiators vs alternatives
- Strong proof points / customer examples
- Common objections and how to answer them
