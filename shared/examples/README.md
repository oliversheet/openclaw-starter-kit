# Content Examples (Curated)

Approved examples used to train agent taste and maintain consistency.

## Rules
- Only store approved or intentionally annotated examples here
- Prefer 5-10 strong examples per channel over large dumps
- Add a short note explaining why each example is good (or what failed)

## Layout
- `blogs/` - blog posts and long-form articles
- `newsletters/` - newsletter issues and sections
- `social/` - social posts/captions/hooks
- `annotation-template.md` - template for documenting why an example matters
