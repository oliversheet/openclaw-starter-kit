# Do / Don't (Writing)

## Do
- Explain why something matters in practice
- Use real workflow examples
- Name tradeoffs plainly
- Write for how interior designers actually work

## Don't
- Use empty phrases like "revolutionize your workflow"
- Overpromise outcomes
- Sound like a generic SaaS landing page
- Add filler just to sound polished

## Example Pattern (Good)
- "Start with a simple stack you can run consistently. Add complexity only when a real bottleneck shows up."

## Example Pattern (Bad)
- "Unlock seamless synergies across your creative design ecosystem."

## To Fill In
- Paste approved snippets and explain why they work
- Add examples of copy that was too vague / too salesy
