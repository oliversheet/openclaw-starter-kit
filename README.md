# OpenClaw Starter Kit 🐾

A battle-tested workspace template for giving your AI agent personality, memory, autonomy, and a whole squad.

Built by [@jeffweisbein](https://x.com/jeffweisbein) — shared on [This Week in Startups](https://thisweekinstartups.com).

## What is this?

This is the exact workspace structure that powers a personal AI assistant with:

- 🧠 **Persistent memory** across sessions (daily logs + curated long-term memory)
- 🎭 **Real personality** — opinions, tone, boundaries (not a corporate chatbot)
- 👥 **Multi-agent squad** — content writer, dev ops, researcher that coordinate autonomously
- 🔒 **Safety policies** — auto-approve rules, daily caps, hard stops for dangerous actions
- ⚡ **Proactive behavior** — checks email, calendar, mentions without being asked
- 🔄 **Agent reactions** — agents trigger each other (tweet posted → analyze engagement → draft followup)

## Quick Start

1. Install OpenClaw: `npm i -g openclaw` (or see [docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai))
2. Copy these files into your OpenClaw workspace (default: `~/clawd/`)
3. Fill in `USER.md` with your info
4. Fill in `IDENTITY.md` to name your AI
5. Start chatting — your AI will evolve from there

```bash
# Copy the starter kit
cp -r openclaw-starter-kit/* ~/clawd/
mkdir -p ~/clawd/memory

# Start OpenClaw
openclaw gateway start
```

## What's Inside

### Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating manual — behavior, safety, when to speak vs stay quiet |
| `SOUL.md` | Personality — opinions, values, tone |
| `USER.md` | About you — preferences, work style, projects |
| `IDENTITY.md` | The AI's own identity — name, vibe, emoji |
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-term memory — curated by the AI over time |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic checks — what to monitor proactively |
| `TOOLS.md` | Local tool notes — device names, SSH hosts, quirks |
| `SQUAD.md` | Multi-agent setup guide — how to run a team of AI agents |

### Multi-Agent Squad (`agents/`)

Pre-configured specialized agents:

```
agents/
├── content-agent/    — tweets, blogs, outreach (never posts without approval)
│   ├── SOUL.md
│   └── WORKING.md   — draft queue
├── dev-agent/        — code review, monitoring, bug triage
│   ├── SOUL.md
│   └── TICK.md       — activity log
└── research-agent/   — analytics, competitors, market intel
    ├── SOUL.md
    └── FINDINGS.md   — research reports
```

### Operations (`ops/`)

Battle-tested governance:

- **`policies.json`** — auto-approve rules, daily caps, work hours, hard stops
- **`reaction-matrix.json`** — agents react to each other's events (emergent behavior!)

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

- **`example-heartbeat-check.sh`** — template for efficient heartbeat checks (scripts are free, model time is expensive)

## How Memory Works

```
Session 1: AI learns you prefer short updates
  → writes to memory/2026-02-23.md
  → updates MEMORY.md with the preference

Session 2: AI wakes up fresh, reads MEMORY.md
  → knows your preferences from day one
  → continues where it left off
```

**Daily files** (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) = raw logs of what happened
**Long-term** (`MEMORY.md`) = curated wisdom, reviewed and distilled periodically

The AI maintains its own memory during heartbeats — reviewing daily logs and updating MEMORY.md like a human reviewing their journal.

## How the Agent Squad Works

```
YOU → text your AI → COORDINATOR delegates → AGENTS work → results flow back
```

- **Content agent** drafts a tweet → queues in WORKING.md → coordinator reviews → you approve → posted
- **Dev agent** spots a failing CI → alerts coordinator → you get a text
- **Research agent** finds competitor launched a feature → reports in FINDINGS.md → content agent drafts a response

Agents react to each other via `reaction-matrix.json`:
- Tweet posted → research agent analyzes engagement (50% chance, after 1 hour)
- Bug detected → alert human immediately (100% chance, no delay)
- High engagement → content agent drafts followup (70% chance)

## Philosophy

> Scripts are free. Model time is expensive.

Heartbeat checks should be shell scripts that output NOTHING when there's nothing to do. The AI only wakes up when there's actual output to act on.

> Never auto-approve the dangerous stuff.

Tweets, emails, deploys, deletes — always require human approval. Research, analysis, health checks — auto-approve freely.

> Your AI is only as good as the context you give it.

Fill in USER.md. Name your AI. Tell it your preferences. The more it knows, the better it gets.
