# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

*Last updated: (auto-updated by your AI)*

<!-- 
This is your AI's curated long-term memory.
It will fill this in over time as it learns about you, your projects, and your preferences.
Think of it as the AI's journal — distilled wisdom, not raw logs.

Sections to expect:
- About your human (preferences, work style)
- Project notes (architectures, decisions, gotchas)
- Key bugs fixed (so they don't repeat)
- Important rules and lessons learned
